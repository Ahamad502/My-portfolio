<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm a CSE student at Gudlavalleru Engineering College, currently juggling sem exams, side projects, and an unhealthy amount of caffeine. I speak fluent C, Java, and Python — and sometimes even human.</p>

<p>I once survived a 36-hour hackathon at VR Siddhartha Engineering College in Vijayawada (yes, I'm still recovering). Whether it's building cool stuff, solving problems, or just debugging at 3 AM while questioning life choices — I’m all in.</p>

<p>When I'm not coding, I’m probably making memes, playing games, or pretending to be productive.</p>

<p>Let’s build something awesome — or at least something that compiles without errors!</p>
